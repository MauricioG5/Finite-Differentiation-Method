# Interpolation by finite derivative differenciation

## Description

It uses a recursive function to calculate a finite differentiation aproximation of a given vector.

This MATLAB code uses a recursive function DDF to calculate the finite derivative difference of a a function represented with two vectors X and Y.
This method is used to calculate an interpolation of a function expressed as a group of numbers.

At the end you will get a second order function wich is the interpolation of the set of points given.

## Execution


To execute this code, first you must copy both files on the same folder, then, you must open the file "interpolacion" on MATLAB, click RUN and write:

1. Number of input points
2. X points
3. Y points

## Result
Then you will get a function like: A*X^2 + B*X + C
